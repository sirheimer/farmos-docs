## How Rotation Works

**Each account maintains a queue** of assigned content. Posting rotates through this queue.

### Single Content Piece

**Account has 1 content piece assigned:**
- Posts same content daily (different variation if multi-account)

**Use when:** Testing one specific piece across multiple accounts

### Multiple Content Pieces

**Account has 4 content pieces assigned (posting 2x/day):**

**Day 1:** Content A (morning), Content B (evening)  
**Day 2:** Content C (morning), Content D (evening)  
**Day 3:** Content A (morning), Content B (evening)  
**...rotation continues**

**Content cycles every 2 days** with this setup.

## Rotation Best Practices

**Optimal content per account:**
- 1x/day posting: 3-4 content pieces
- 2x/day posting: 4-6 content pieces
- 3x/day posting: 6-8 content pieces

**Why:** Enough variety without content getting stale.
