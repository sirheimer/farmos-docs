description: How Juice determines when to post your content

## How Scheduling Works

**You don't set posting times.** Juice determines optimal times based on:
- TikTok algorithm activity patterns
- Your audience's active hours
- Account's historical performance
- Platform-wide engagement trends

## Posting Windows

Content typically posts during:

**Morning:** 7-10 AM (local timezone)  
**Afternoon:** 1-3 PM  
**Evening:** 7-10 PM  

**Why these times:** Highest TikTok engagement across most demographics.

<Info>
TikTok's algorithm distributes content over hours/days, not instantly. Posting time matters less than content quality.
