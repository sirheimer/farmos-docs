## Automated Posting

Once you assign content to an account:
1. Content queues in posting schedule
2. Juice posts at optimal times
3. Content rotates through assigned pieces
4. You monitor performance

**Zero manual posting required.**

## Posting Schedule

Each account posts based on its frequency setting:

| Frequency | Timing | Total Posts/Week |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **1x/day** | Once daily | 7 |
| **2x/day** | Morning + Evening | 14 |
| **3x/day** | Morning + Afternoon + Evening | 21 |

**Posting times are algorithm-optimized** - Juice chooses when your audience is most active.

## Content Rotation

If an account has multiple content pieces assigned, it rotates through them:

**Example: Account with 3 content pieces, posting 1x/day**
- Monday: Content A
- Tuesday: Content B
- Wednesday: Content C
- Thursday: Content A (rotates back)
- Friday: Content B
- And so on...

**Why rotation:** Prevents repetition, tests different content, keeps feed diverse.

## Variation Distribution

When you assign content to multiple accounts, each gets a unique variation:

**Example: Content with 10 variations assigned to 6 accounts**
- Account 1: Variation 1
- Account 2: Variation 2
- Account 3: Variation 3
- Account 4: Variation 4
- Account 5: Variation 5
- Account 6: Variation 6

**No two accounts post the same video** - prevents duplication flags.
