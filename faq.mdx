description: Common questions about using Juice
---

## General

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Juice?">
    Juice is an automated organic distribution platform for TikTok. It combines AI content generation with multi-account management to help brands scale their organic reach without hiring a full video production team.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is this different from posting manually?">
    **Manual approach:** Create videos one-by-one, post from 1-2 accounts, manage everything yourself
    
    **Juice:** AI generates content in minutes, posts to 6-18 accounts automatically, handles warmup and scheduling
    
    **Result:** 10-20x more content testing capacity with 90% less time investment
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this against TikTok's terms of service?">
    Juice operates within TikTok's automation guidelines. Each account behaves like a real user (warmup, gradual activity, unique content). We don't spam, use bots, or violate platform policies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long until I see results?">
    **First post:** 7-10 days (after account warmup)  
    **Meaningful data:** 30 days (need posting history)  
    **First viral post:** 30-45 days (for most customers)
    
    Organic growth is a marathon, not a sprint.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need video editing skills?">
    No. Juice's AI generates complete videos from text prompts. No Premiere Pro, no After Effects, no design skills required.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Content Creation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use my own videos?">
    Currently, Juice generates slideshow-style content using templates. You can upload reference images/photos, but not import full custom videos.
    
    **Coming soon:** Custom video upload support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I make content more on-brand?">
    Three ways:
    1. **Complete your Brand Kit** with detailed voice, colors, and messaging
    2. **Use Image References** to include your actual product photos
    3. **Set Creative Control higher** (0.7-1.0) to maximize brand customization
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't like the generated content?">
    You have unlimited iterations:
    - Edit with text prompts ("make background darker")
    - Regenerate with same topic (get new version)
    - Try different template
    - Add reference images for guidance
    
    Most users get content they like within 1-2 edits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many content pieces should I create per week?">
    **Minimum:** 5-7 pieces (enough for 1x/day posting on 6 accounts)  
    **Optimal:** 10-15 pieces (enables 2x/day + testing)  
    **Advanced:** 20-30 pieces (3x/day + extensive testing)
    
    Start with 5-7 weekly and scale as you get faster at content creation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I schedule content for specific dates?">
    Not currently. Juice uses algorithm-optimized posting times. Content posts when it's most likely to perform, not on specific dates.
    
    **Workaround:** Assign content when you want it to start posting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Accounts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long does account warmup take?">
    **Typical:** 3-7 days  
    **Range:** Can be as short as 3 days or as long as 10 days
    
    Warmup ensures accounts aren't flagged as spam when they start posting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I post to these accounts manually?">
    No. Juice-managed accounts are fully automated. Manual posting would interfere with the automation.
    
    **For manual posting:** Use your personal TikTok account separately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many accounts should I create?">
    **Starter:** 4-6 accounts (manageable, good testing)  
    **Growth:** 8-12 accounts (serious scale)  
    **Enterprise:** 15+ accounts (maximum reach)
    
    Start with 6, add more after 30 days if performing well.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are some accounts not posting?">
    **Check:**
    - Still in warmup? (Check status + day counter)
    - Content assigned? (Go to account detail)
    - Content active? (Check content settings)
    
    **Most common:** Account still warming up. Be patient!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete or archive accounts?">
    Yes. From account settings, click "Archive Account." This:
    - Stops posting
    - Frees up account slot
    - Preserves historical data
    
    **Can't be undone** - create fresh account instead of restoring.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between branded and faceless accounts?">
    **Branded:**
    - Uses your company name/logo
    - Professional profile
    - Attracts people who know your brand
    - Best for brand awareness
    
    **Faceless:**
    - Generic username about niche
    - Content-focused profile
    - Attracts people searching topics
    - Best for broader reach
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Posting & Scheduling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When do my posts go live?">
    Juice posts during algorithm-optimized times:
    - Morning: 7-10 AM
    - Afternoon: 1-3 PM
    - Evening: 7-10 PM
    
    **You can't control exact times** (and you don't need to - algorithm handles distribution).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I post the same video to multiple accounts?">
    No - and you shouldn't! Juice generates **unique variations** for each account to avoid duplication flags from TikTok.
    
    **Each account posts a unique version** of the same content concept.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often should accounts post?">
    **Week 1-2:** 1x/day (during warmup)  
    **Week 3-6:** 2x/day (if averaging 5K+ views)  
    **Week 7+:** 3x/day (if averaging 10K+ views)
    
    Scale frequency based on performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I pause posting temporarily?">
    Yes. From account settings, click "Pause Account." Resume anytime.
    
    **Use when:** Taking a break, fixing strategy, or troubleshooting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Analytics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How are views counted?">
    TikTok counts a view when someone watches any portion of your video. Views update in real-time (data refreshes every 30 seconds in Juice).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's a good viral rate?">
    **5% = Good** (1 in 20 posts hits 100K+ views)  
    **10% = Great** (1 in 10 posts goes viral)  
    **15%+ = Exceptional**
    
    Most brands average 5-8% viral rate after 90 days of consistent posting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I download my posted videos?">

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see which specific account posted what?">
    Yes. Posts page shows account name for each post. Filter by account to see all posts from specific accounts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does it take to see views on new posts?">
    **Initial views:** 1-6 hours after posting  
    **Peak views:** 24-72 hours after posting  
    **Long tail:** Can continue getting views for weeks
    
    Don't judge performance in first 24 hours - give it 3-7 days.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My content is generating slowly">
    **Normal generation:** 15-30 seconds  
    **Slow generation:** 45+ seconds
    
    **Causes of slowness:**
    - High Creative Control (1.0)
    - Many reference images (4+)
    - Complex templates (12+ slides)
    
    **Speed up:** Use moderate settings (Creative Control 0.5, fewer references)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content looks off-brand">
    **Fix:**
    1. Complete your Brand Kit fully
    2. Run "Enrich" on Brand Kit
    3. Increase Creative Control to 0.7-1.0
    4. Add reference images showing your brand style
    5. Use "Edit" or "New" Image Mode (not "Original")
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Views are very low across all accounts">
    **Potential causes:**
    - Accounts still in warmup (wait 3-7 days)
    - Content quality needs improvement (test different templates)
    - Need more accounts for statistically significant data
    - Topic/niche mismatch with account setup
    
    **Wait 30 days** of consistent posting before judging. If still low, contact support for strategy review.
