## Content That Performs

Not all content is created equal. Here's what works on TikTok in 2026:

### The Perfect Hook (First 1-2 Seconds)

Your hook determines whether people scroll past or watch. Winning hooks:

**❌ Weak Hooks:**
- "Hey guys, welcome back..."
- "Today I want to talk about..."
- Slow intro with logo reveal

**✅ Strong Hooks:**
- "This one feature saved me 10 hours this week"
- "Most SaaS companies get this wrong"
- "Here's what $100K in ads taught me about..."

<Tip>
**Template Advantage:** Juice templates start with strong visual hooks automatically. You just need to provide the compelling statement.
</Tip>

### Clear Value Proposition

Within 3-5 seconds, viewers should know:
- What they'll learn
- Why they should care
- How it helps them

**Example flow:**
1. Hook (0-2 sec): "This productivity hack is insane"
2. Value prop (2-5 sec): "It tripled my output in one week"
3. Delivery (5-30 sec): Show the actual hack
4. CTA (30-35 sec): "Try it and let me know if it works"

### Visual Consistency

Your content should be recognizable:
- **Consistent colors** - Use your brand colors in every video
- **Consistent fonts** - Same typography across content
- **Consistent style** - Branded vs faceless vs UGC should be consistent per account

This builds brand recognition even without followers.

## Testing Variations

The key to finding winning content is systematic testing.

### Test One Variable at a Time

**Good test:**
- Same template
- Same topic
- Different hook on first slide
- Results: Hook A got 5K views, Hook B got 50K views

**Bad test:**
- Different template
- Different topic
- Different hook
- Results: You don't know what worked

### What to Test

| Variable | How to Test | Time to Results |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Hooks** | 5 different hooks, same content | 3 days |
| **Topics** | 5 different topics, same template | 7 days |
| **Templates** | 3 different templates, same general topic | 14 days |
| **Personas** | Branded vs faceless vs UGC | 30 days |

### The 7-Day Test

For each new content idea:

1. **Create content** with 1 template
2. **Post to 6 accounts** (variations distributed)
3. **Wait 7 days** for data
4. **Analyze results:**
   - Did any variations hit 10K+ views?
   - What's the average engagement rate?
   - Did any go viral (100K+ views)?
5. **Decision:**
   - If yes → Create more content with that template/topic
   - If no → Test a new template/topic

<Warning>
**Don't give up too early!** Content can take 3-7 days to hit peak performance. The algorithm tests your content gradually.
</Warning>

## Iteration Strategy

Here's a proven roadmap for your first 90 days:

### Month 1: Testing Phase

**Goals:**
- Test 3-4 templates
- Create 20-30 unique posts
- Identify 1-2 winning templates

**Actions:**
- Post 1x per day per account
- Track which templates get &gt;10K average views
- Note which topics generate engagement

### Month 2: Scaling Phase

**Goals:**
- Double down on winning templates
- Increase posting frequency
- Expand account pool

**Actions:**
- Create only winning template content
- Increase to 2x per day per account
- Add 3-6 more accounts focused on winners

### Month 3: Optimization Phase

**Goals:**
- Maximize viral rate
- Refine hooks and messaging
- Build sustainable posting rhythm

**Actions:**
- A/B test hooks on winning content
- 3x per day posting on best accounts
- Archive underperforming accounts

## Posting Frequency Recommendations

More content = more visibility, but quality matters:

### Conservative Approach
- **1x per day** per account
- 6 accounts = 42 posts per week
- Best for: Testing phase, limited content library

### Balanced Approach
- **2x per day** per account
- 6 accounts = 84 posts per week
- Best for: Scaling winning content

### Aggressive Approach
- **3x per day** per account
- 6 accounts = 126 posts per week
- Best for: Maximizing reach with proven content

<Info>
**Juice Recommendation:** Start with 1x per day during warmup and first 2 weeks. Once you identify winning content, scale to 2-3x per day on those accounts.
</Info>

## Content Calendar Strategy

You don't need to create new content daily. Here's a sustainable approach:

### Weekly Batch Creation

Every Monday, create content for the week:

1. **20 minutes:** Generate 2-3 new content ideas (different templates)
2. **10 minutes:** Edit and approve each
3. **5 minutes:** Assign to accounts

**Total time:** ~1 hour per week for 18-24 posts across 6 accounts.

### Content Library Building

As you approve content, you build a library:
- Evergreen content can be reused after 30 days
- High-performing content can be duplicated
- Templates can be filled with new topics quickly

**After 3 months, you'll have:**
- 30-50 approved content pieces
- Clear data on what works
- A repeatable system for content creation

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Posting the Same Content on All Accounts

This duplicates content and confuses the algorithm. **Juice automatically creates variations to prevent this.**

### ❌ Giving Up After 1 Week

Organic growth takes time. Most accounts need 2-4 weeks of consistent posting to start seeing traction.

### ❌ Ignoring Data

Check your dashboard weekly. If content isn't hitting 5K+ average views after 7 days, try a different template or topic.

### ❌ Over-Optimizing Too Early

Don't tweak content after every post. Give it 7 days and 6+ posts before making changes.

### ❌ Creating Content Without Brand Kit

Your Brand Kit ensures content sounds like you. Skipping this makes content generic.

## Advanced Strategies

### Viral Content Replication

When a post hits 100K+ views:
1. Analyze what made it work (hook? topic? template?)
2. Create 3-5 variations of the same concept
3. Post to all accounts
4. Ride the wave

### Cross-Platform Distribution

Once content proves viral on TikTok:
- Enable cross-posting to Instagram Reels
- Enable cross-posting to YouTube Shorts
- 3x the reach with same content

### Seasonal Content Banking

Create content in batches for:
- Industry events
- Holidays
- Product launches
- Seasonal trends

Approve and schedule ahead of time.

## Success Metrics

What does "success" look like? Benchmarks by account:

| Metric | Good | Great | Exceptional |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| Avg views per post | 5K+ | 10K+ | 25K+ |
| Viral rate | 5% | 10% | 20% |
| Engagement rate | 3% | 5% | 8% |
| Follower growth | 50/week | 200/week | 500/week |

<Warning>
These are general benchmarks. B2B content typically gets lower views but higher-quality engagement than B2C content. Focus on what drives your business goals (leads, awareness, conversions).
</Warning>

## The Long Game

Organic distribution is a marathon, not a sprint:

- **Weeks 1-4:** Setup, warmup, initial testing
- **Weeks 5-8:** Find winning templates and topics
- **Weeks 9-12:** Scale winning content across accounts
- **Month 4+:** Consistent organic traffic machine

Most Juice customers see their first viral post (100K+ views) within 30-45 days of consistent posting.
