## Brand Kit Best Practices

### Be Specific About Your Audience

**Instead of:** "Business professionals"  
**Write:** "Marketing managers at B2B SaaS companies with 50-500 employees"

The more specific your ideal customer profile, the better the AI can tailor content.

### Include Competitor Context

Listing 3-5 competitors helps the AI understand:
- Your market positioning
- Differentiation points
- Industry language

### Use Keyword-Rich Descriptions

**Instead of:** "We make software"  
**Write:** "We build AI-powered project management tools that help remote teams collaborate asynchronously"

More keywords = better algorithmic targeting.

### Enrich Regularly

If you update your website or brand positioning, click **Enrich** again to refresh your Brand Kit with latest information.

## Template Selection Best Practices

### Start with 3 Templates Maximum

Don't overwhelm yourself. Pick 3 templates and master them before adding more:
- 1 educational template (e.g., "3 Ways to...")
- 1 problem/solution template
- 1 storytelling template

### Match Template to Content Type

| Content Type | Best Template Style |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Product features | Listicle ("5 features you need") |
| Customer pain points | Problem/Solution |
| Industry insights | Educational guide |
| Case studies | Before/After |
| Brand story | Storytelling |

### Test Template Performance

After 14 days, check which templates get the highest average views. Focus 80% of content creation on your top-performing template.

## Content Creation Best Practices

### Topic Selection

**Good topics are:**
- Specific and actionable
- Solve a clear problem
- Relevant to your niche

**Examples:**

**❌ Too vague:**
- "Marketing tips"
- "How to grow"
- "Our product"

**✅ Specific:**
- "How to write cold emails that get 40% response rates"
- "3 mistakes killing your landing page conversion"
- "This feature automates 10 hours of data entry per week"

### Using References Effectively

Upload reference images when:
- You have product photos you want to use
- You want a specific aesthetic
- You need brand consistency

**Image References:** Your product in the slides  
**Style References:** The mood/aesthetic of the images  
**Omni Reference:** Complete style transfer (use sparingly)

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** For product-focused content, use Image Mode "Original" with your product photos as references. For educational content, use Image Mode "New" to let AI generate fresh visuals.
</Tip>

### Editing Strategy

Don't over-edit. Follow this priority:

1. **Must fix:** Factual errors, off-brand messaging
2. **Should fix:** Awkward phrasing, unclear visuals
3. **Nice to fix:** Minor color tweaks, font preferences

Each edit iteration takes time. Aim for 0-2 edits per content piece.

## Account Management Best Practices

### Account Mix Strategy

**For most brands, this mix works well:**
- 50% Branded accounts (build brand awareness)
- 30% Faceless accounts (maximize reach)
- 20% UGC accounts (build trust)

**Example with 6 accounts:**
- 3 branded
- 2 faceless
- 1 UGC

### Account Naming

Good usernames are:
- **Short** (12-20 characters)
- **Memorable**
- **Niche-relevant**
- **Not obviously automated**

**Examples:**

**❌ Bad:**
- `brand_official_2`
- `marketingtips12345`
- `untitled_account`

**✅ Good:**
- `growthtactics`
- `saashacks`
- `productivity_lab`

<Info>
Juice's AI generates good usernames automatically, but you can customize them during account creation.

### Profile Bio Optimization

Your bio should:
- State what you post about (10-15 words)
- Include 1-2 relevant keywords
- Optional: Link to your website

**Example:** "SaaS growth tactics for B2B marketers 📈 | Founder @YourBrand"

### Don't Rush Warmup

**Tempting:** Skip warmup and start posting immediately  
**Reality:** Accounts without warmup get shadowbanned

Always wait for accounts to complete warmup (3-7 days) before posting.

## Posting Best Practices

### Frequency Sweet Spot

| Phase | Frequency | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Week 1-2 | 1x/day | Building algorithm trust |
| Week 3-6 | 2x/day | Scaling reach |
| Week 7+ | 2-3x/day | Maximum visibility |

### Content Rotation

Never post the same variation to multiple accounts. Juice handles this automatically, but verify:
- Each account has unique approved content
- Variations are properly distributed

### Timing

**Don't worry about posting times.** TikTok's algorithm distributes content over hours/days, not instantly. Post anytime - the algorithm will show it when your audience is active.

## Analytics Best Practices

### Check Dashboard Weekly

Don't obsess daily. Check once per week:
- Which content hit 10K+ views?
- What's your viral rate this week?
- Which accounts are performing best?

### Key Metrics to Track

Focus on these metrics (in order of importance):

1. **Average views per post** - Overall reach
2. **Viral rate** - % of posts hitting 100K+ views
3. **Engagement rate** - Likes + comments / views
4. **Follower growth** - Secondary to views

<Warning>
**Follower count doesn't matter** on TikTok. A video from an account with 100 followers can outperform an account with 10K followers. Focus on content performance, not follower count.
</Warning>

### Using Performance Data

After 30 days of data:

**Identify patterns:**
- Which templates consistently perform?
- Which topics generate most engagement?
- Which account types get best reach?

**Take action:**
- Create more of what works
- Stop creating what doesn't
- Test new variations of winners

## Scaling Best Practices

### When to Add More Accounts

Add accounts when:
- You have 3+ high-performing content templates
- Your current accounts are posting 2-3x/day consistently
- You're hitting 50K+ views per week total
- You have capacity to create more content variations

**Don't add accounts if:**
- You're still in testing phase (first 30 days)
- Current accounts aren't posting yet (warmup)
- You don't have enough content to keep them fed

### When to Scale Posting Frequency

Increase from 1x to 2x or 3x per day when:
- Accounts have been posting for 14+ days
- Average views per post is 5K+
- You have enough content variations (20+ approved pieces)

### Content Replication

Found a viral post? Don't just repost it. Instead:
1. **Duplicate the content** in Juice
2. **Modify the hook** slightly
3. **Regenerate** with same template
4. **Post to accounts** that haven't used it yet

This captures the winning formula while staying fresh for the algorithm.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "My accounts aren't posting"

**Check:**
- Are they still in warmup? (Check status)
- Do they have content assigned?
- Is the content set to active?

### "My content is getting low views"

**Try:**
- Test a different template
- Sharpen your hooks (first 2 seconds matter most)
- Ensure Brand Kit accurately reflects your niche
- Wait 7 days before judging (algorithm needs time)

### "All my accounts have the same content"

**This shouldn't happen.** Juice generates unique variations. If you're seeing duplicates:
- Verify you approved the content (this triggers variation generation)
- Check that accounts are assigned different variation IDs
