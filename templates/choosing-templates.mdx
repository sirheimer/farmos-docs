description: How to pick the right video templates for your content strategy
---

## Selection Criteria

Choose templates based on:

1. **Your content type** - What you want to talk about
2. **Your audience** - Who you're targeting
3. **Your goal** - Awareness vs leads vs sales
4. **Your testing capacity** - How many you can manage

## Template Selection Framework

### Start with "The Big 3"

For most brands, start with these three template types:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Listicle" icon="list">
    "3 Ways to...", "5 Tips for..."
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="How-To" icon="book">
    "How to... in X steps"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Problem/Solution" icon="lightbulb">
    Pain point → your solution
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Why these three:** Highest success rate across all industries

### Then Add Specialized Templates

After mastering the big 3, add templates for specific use cases:

**For thought leadership:**
- "Common Mistakes..."
- "The Truth About..."
- "What Nobody Tells You..."

**For product marketing:**
- "Before & After"
- "Feature Showcase"
- "Product Comparison"

**For storytelling:**
- "Our Journey"
- "Customer Story"
- "Behind the Scenes"
