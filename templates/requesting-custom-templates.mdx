## When to Request Custom Templates

**Request custom templates when:**
- Your industry has unique visual styles not covered by existing templates
- You have a specific viral format you want to replicate
- Your brand has strict design requirements
- You've exhausted existing templates and need fresh formats

**Use existing templates when:**
- You're just starting (first 30 days)
- Existing templates are performing well
- You haven't tested all templates yet

<Tip>
**Test existing templates first.** Most brands find 2-3 templates that work well in the existing library before needing custom ones.

## What to Include in Your Request

### Template Description

**Provide 2-4 TikTok URLs** showing the style you want:
- Link to viral TikToks using similar format
- Videos from your niche
- Competitors' content (for format only)

**Example:**
```
Reference 1: https://tiktok.com/@brand/video/123 
(Love the slide transition style)

Reference 2: https://tiktok.com/@competitor/video/456
(Similar layout to what we need)
```

### Use Case Description

**Explain how you'll use it:**
- "We'll create 10+ pieces of content showcasing our different features"

**Why it matters:** Helps team prioritize and understand impact.

### Unique Requirements

**Mention any specific needs:**
- Must show side-by-side comparisons
- Needs space for long-form text
