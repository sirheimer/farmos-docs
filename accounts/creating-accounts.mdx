## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I create accounts without content ready?">
    Yes! Create accounts first, assign content later. Accounts will warmup while you create content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long until accounts start posting?">
    3-7 days for warmup, then posting begins immediately. Total time from creation to first post: ~7 days.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit account profiles after creation?">
    Yes, but only before posting starts. Once an account is posting, username/bio changes aren't recommended (can affect algorithm).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I run out of account slots?">
    Upgrade your plan to get more slots, or archive underperforming accounts to free up space.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manually post to these accounts?">
    No. Juice-managed accounts are fully automated. For manual posting, use your personal TikTok account.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

### Start Small

**First batch:** 4-6 accounts  
**Why:** Easier to manage, faster to learn, less overwhelming

**After 30 days:** Add more based on performance.

### Mix Account Types

**Don't:** Create 6 of the same type  
**Do:** Mix 3-4 types to test what works

**Why:** Different types reach different audiences.

### Batch Creation

**Don't:** Create 1 account at a time over weeks  
**Do:** Create all accounts in one batch

**Why:** They warmup together, start posting together, easier to compare performance.

### Custom Profiles Matter

**Spend 5 minutes customizing profiles:**
- Better usernames = higher follow rates
- Better bios = clearer value proposition
- Better profile pics = more professional appearance
