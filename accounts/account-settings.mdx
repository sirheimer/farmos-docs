## Best Practices

### Frequency Scaling

**Week 1-2:** 1x/day (warmup phase)  
**Week 3-6:** 2x/day (if avg views &gt;5K)  
**Week 7+:** 3x/day (if avg views &gt;10K)

### Cross-Posting Timing

**Enable Instagram:** After 14+ days of TikTok success  
**Enable YouTube:** After 30+ days of TikTok success

**Why:** Prove content works on TikTok first, then expand.

### Content Assignment

**Assign 3-5 content pieces per account:**
- Enough variety for rotation
- Not so much that content gets stale

**Update monthly:**
- Remove underperforming content
- Add new high-performers

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I post manually to Juice-managed accounts?">
    No. Juice accounts are fully automated. Manual posting isn't supported and could interfere with automation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change username after account is created?">
    Not recommended once posting starts. Username changes can confuse TikTok's algorithm and hurt performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I pause an account?">
    Posting stops immediately. Warmup status is preserved. Resume anytime to continue posting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I un-archive an account?">
    Contact support. Generally, creating a fresh account performs better than restoring archived ones.
  </Accordion>
