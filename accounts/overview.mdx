## What Are Accounts?

In Juice, "accounts" refers to TikTok profiles that:
- Are automatically created and managed by Juice
- Post your AI-generated content
- Build independent audiences
- Contribute to your total organic reach

**Each account is a separate TikTok presence** with its own:
- Username and profile
- Posting schedule
- Content assignments
- Performance metrics

## Why Multiple Accounts?

Running multiple accounts isn't about spam - it's about **strategic testing and scale**:

### Test Different Personas

| Account Type | Persona | Audience It Attracts |
|--------------|---------|----------------------|
| **Branded** | Your company | Brand loyalists, B2B decision-makers |
| **Faceless** | Educational/content-first | Learners, algorithm-driven discoverers |
| **UGC** | Person-based creator | Relatable, trust-seeking viewers |

Each persona reaches a different slice of your total addressable audience.

### Test Content Variations

With 6 accounts posting 6 variations of the same topic:
- You get 6 data points instead of 1
- Learn what hooks/styles work faster
- Reduce risk of one account's poor performance

### Scale Organic Reach

More accounts = more content in algorithm = more total views:

| Accounts | Posts/Day Each | Total Posts/Week |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | 1x | 7 |
| 6 | 1x | 42 |
| 6 | 2x | 84 |
| 12 | 2x | 168 |

**More content = more algorithmic impressions.**

4. Create 6 more accounts matching top performer type
5. Scale winning content across all 12 accounts

### Strategy 2: Persona Diversification

1. Create 2 branded accounts
2. Create 2 faceless accounts
3. Create 2 UGC accounts
4. Assign different content styles to each type:
   - Branded: Thought leadership
   - Faceless: Educational how-to's
   - UGC: Personal stories/testimonials
5. See which persona + content combo performs best

### Strategy 3: Niche Domination

1. Create 12 faceless accounts
2. All focused on same niche
3. Post different templates/topics to each
4. Saturate algorithm with your brand's perspective
5. Build authority through volume

- ✅ Engagement rate steady or growing
- ✅ No violations/warnings

**Red flags (investigate):**
- ⚠️ Sudden view drop (possible shadowban)
