## Brand Information Fields

After creation, you'll fill in (or AI-enrich) these fields:

### About Your Brand

**What to write:** 2-3 sentences describing what your company does.

**Example (SaaS):**
```
Acme is an AI-powered project management platform that helps 
remote teams stay aligned without meetings. We serve fast-growing 
startups with 10-100 employees who need async collaboration.
```

**Example (E-commerce):**
```
Acme creates premium, sustainable outdoor gear for weekend adventurers. 
Our products combine eco-friendly materials with minimalist design for 
conscious consumers aged 25-40.
```

<Tip>
**Be specific!** Instead of "we help businesses," write "we help B2B SaaS companies reduce churn by 20%."
</Tip>

### Product/Service Description

**What to write:** Detailed description of what you're selling.

**Example:**
```
Our core product is a visual project management board with built-in 
time tracking, resource allocation, and automated status updates. 
Key features include: AI-powered task prioritization, Slack integration, 
and real-time collaboration.
```

**Why it matters:** This helps AI mention specific features in content.

### Ideal Customer Profile

**What to write:** Detailed description of who your content targets.

**Example:**
```
Marketing managers at B2B SaaS companies with 50-500 employees. 
They're struggling with content production at scale and need to 
prove ROI. Age 28-45, tech-savvy, values efficiency and data-driven decisions.
```

**Why it matters:** AI tailors messaging to resonate with this audience.

### Competitors

**What to add:** 3-5 direct competitors (click to add each)

**Example (Project Management):**
- Asana
- Monday.com
- ClickUp
- Notion
- Linear

**Why it matters:** Helps AI understand your market position and differentiation points.

### Brand Point of View

**What to write:** Your unique perspective or philosophy.

**Example:**
```
We believe remote work should feel seamless, not chaotic. Meetings 
are often productivity theater. Async-first tools with AI assistance 
are the future of team collaboration.
```

**Why it matters:** Gives AI your "voice" for thought leadership content.

### Author Persona

**What to write:** Who is "speaking" in your content?

**Example (Founder-led):**
```
Experienced SaaS founder who's built and sold 2 companies. Passionate 
about remote work. Direct, no-BS communication style. Shares lessons 
from 15 years in tech.
```

**Example (Brand-led):**
```
Expert project management team that understands the pain of coordination. 
Helpful, knowledgeable tone. Focused on practical solutions over theory.
```

**Why it matters:** Defines the "narrator" voice in your content.

### Tone of Voice

**What to write:** How your brand sounds.

**Examples:**
- "Professional yet approachable, data-driven, avoids jargon"
- "Casual and fun, uses emojis, speaks like a friend"
- "Authoritative and educational, evidence-based, academic but accessible"

**Why it matters:** AI matches this tone in all generated text.

### Content Goal

**What to write:** What you want content to achieve.

**Examples:**
- "Drive product signups from developers and technical decision-makers"
- "Build brand awareness and position us as thought leaders in productivity"
- "Generate leads from enterprise marketing teams"
- "Drive e-commerce sales from eco-conscious millennials"

**Why it matters:** Shapes the call-to-action and overall content strategy.

## Visual Identity Fields

### Brand Colors

**What to add:** 2-6 hex color codes

**How to add:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Click '+' Button">
    In the Brand Colors section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick Color">
    Use color picker or paste hex code (#4EEC5D)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add More">
    Repeat for all brand colors
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Recommended:**
- Primary brand color
- Secondary color

- Sans Serif (modern, clean)
- Serif (traditional, authoritative)
- Monospace (technical, developer-focused)
- Cursive (creative, personal)
- Display (bold, attention-grabbing)
- Other (custom)

**Why it matters:** Affects font selection in generated content.

## TikTok Targeting Fields

### TikTok Niche/Keywords

**What to write:** Comma-separated keywords for algorithm targeting

**Example (SaaS):**
```
project management, productivity, remote work, SaaS, team collaboration, 
async work, startup tools
```

**Example (E-commerce):**
```
sustainable fashion, eco-friendly, minimalist style, outdoor gear, 
conscious consumer, ethical brands
```

**Why it matters:** These keywords help TikTok's algorithm recommend your content to the right audience.

<Tip>
**Include 8-12 keywords** that describe your niche. Think about what your ideal customers might search for on TikTok.
</Tip>

### TikTok Hashtags

**What to write:** Hashtags you want to use (optional)

## Brand Kit Best Practices

### Be Comprehensive

**Don't skip fields.** Even if AI enrichment fills them in, review and enhance:
- Empty fields = generic content
- Detailed fields = on-brand content

### Use Your Actual Brand Voice

**Don't write:** "Professional tone"  
**Write:** "We're direct and no-nonsense. We call out industry BS. We sound like a smart colleague, not a corporate bot."

**Why:** More personality = more distinctive content.

### Update Regularly

Revisit your Brand Kit quarterly:
- Has your positioning changed?
- New products launched?
- Target audience evolved?
- Tone shifted?

Keep it current for best results.

### Test Multiple Versions

Create variations of your Brand Kit to test:
- Version A: Professional tone
- Version B: Casual tone

Generate same topic with both, see which performs better.
