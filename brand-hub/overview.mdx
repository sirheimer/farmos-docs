## What is Brand Hub?

Brand Hub lets you create and manage **Brand Kits** - collections of brand information that guide AI content generation.

Each Brand Kit contains:
- **Brand Information** - About your brand, products, audience
- **Visual Identity** - Colors, logos, typography
- **Voice & Tone** - How you communicate
- **TikTok Targeting** - Algorithm keywords and hashtags
- **Brand Assets** - Logos, product images, graphics

<Info>
**Think of Brand Kits as profiles for different brands.** If you manage multiple brands (or sub-brands), create separate Brand Kits for each.
</Info>

## Why Brand Kits Matter

Your Brand Kit is what makes AI-generated content sound and look like **your brand**, not generic content.

### Without a Brand Kit:
- AI generates generic content
- No consistent voice
- Random visual styling
- Doesn't target your audience

### With a Brand Kit:
- AI matches your brand voice
- Uses your colors and fonts
- Incorporates your logos
- Targets your specific niche
- References your products/services

**Example:**

**Topic:** "3 ways to improve productivity"

**Without Brand Kit:**
- Generic productivity tips
- Stock images of desk setups
- Casual, general tone

**With Brand Kit (SaaS company):**
- "3 ways [Your SaaS] improves team productivity"
- Screenshots of your product
- Professional tone targeting remote teams
- Your brand colors throughout
