## What is Enrichment?

Enrichment is an AI analysis process that:
- Reads your website content
- Analyzes your LinkedIn company page
- Extracts brand voice, messaging, and positioning
- Auto-fills empty Brand Kit fields
- Enhances existing fields with better descriptions

**Time:** ~30-45 seconds  
**Cost:** Free (included in all plans)

## When to Enrich

### First-Time Setup

After creating a Brand Kit, enrich it immediately to:
- Auto-fill all brand description fields
- Extract your brand voice from website copy
- Identify target audience from website messaging
- Pull product/service descriptions

### After Major Brand Changes

Re-enrich when you:
- Launch new products
- Rebrand or update positioning
- Change target audience
- Update website copy significantly

### Before Big Content Batches

If you're about to create 10+ content pieces, enrich first to ensure latest brand info is used.

## How to Enrich

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Brand Kit">
    From Brand Hub, click your Brand Kit
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Enrich' Button">
    Green "Enrich Brand Kit" button at top-right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Analysis">
    You'll see:
    - "Enriching..." message
    - Progress indicator
    - **Time:** 30-45 seconds
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    All fields update with AI-extracted information
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit if Needed">
    Review each field and adjust anything that's not quite right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save Changes**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Enrichment overwrites existing fields.** If you've carefully crafted descriptions, save them elsewhere before enriching, as enrichment will replace them.
</Warning>

## What Gets Enriched?

Enrichment updates these fields:

| Field | How It's Extracted |
|-------|-------------------|
| **About Brand** | From homepage and about page |
| **Product/Service** | From product pages and descriptions |
| **Ideal Customer** | From website targeting language |
| **Competitors** | From market context and mentions |
| **Brand Point of View** | From mission/values statements |
| **Author Persona** | From about/team pages |
| **Tone of Voice** | From analyzing website copy style |
| **Content Goal** | From CTA patterns and messaging |

**Fields NOT changed by enrichment:**
- Brand Colors (you must add manually)
- Typography (you must select)
- TikTok Keywords (you must write)
- Brand Assets (you must upload)

## Enrichment Quality

### What Makes Enrichment Work Well?

**Good website content:**
- ✅ Clear about page
- ✅ Detailed product descriptions
- ✅ Customer testimonials/case studies
- ✅ Blog with brand voice examples
- ✅ Mission/values page

**Poor website content:**
- ❌ Minimal copy
- ❌ Just landing page with form
- ❌ Generic corporate speak
- ❌ No about/product pages

### Improving Enrichment Results

If enrichment produces generic results:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Secondary URL">
    Point to your most detailed page (e.g., /about or /products)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add LinkedIn URL">
    LinkedIn company pages often have better brand descriptions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manually Edit After Enrichment">
    Use AI-extracted content as a starting point, then refine
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Enrichment Extracts

### Example: SaaS Company

**Website Input:** acme.com (project management SaaS)

**AI Enrichment Output:**

**About Brand:**
```
Acme is a visual project management platform designed for remote-first 
teams. We combine kanban boards, time tracking, and AI-powered insights 
to help distributed teams ship faster without endless meetings.
```

**Product/Service:**
```
Our platform includes visual project boards, automated status updates, 
resource allocation tools, time tracking, and AI task prioritization. 
Built for teams of 10-100 who need clarity without micromanagement.
```

**Ideal Customer:**
```
Product managers and team leads at remote-first companies. They manage 
5-15 person teams and struggle with visibility into project status. 
They value async communication and data-driven decisions.
```

### Example: E-commerce Brand

**Website Input:** brand.com (sustainable apparel)

**AI Enrichment Output:**

**About Brand:**
```
Brand creates sustainable, minimalist clothing for conscious consumers. 
Every piece is made from recycled materials and designed to last years, 
not seasons. We're redefining fashion as investment, not consumption.
```

**Ideal Customer:**
```
Environmentally conscious millennials (25-40) who prioritize quality 
over quantity. They're willing to pay premium for sustainable products 
and care about brand ethics and transparency.
```

## After Enrichment

### Review Everything

Don't blindly trust AI. Review each field:

✅ **Accurate?** - Does it match your actual offering?  
✅ **Specific enough?** - Or is it generic?  
✅ **On-brand?** - Does it sound like you?  
✅ **Complete?** - Any missing information?

### Enhance AI Output

AI provides a foundation. You enhance it:

**AI wrote:** "We help teams be more productive"  
**You enhance:** "We help remote engineering teams ship 30% faster by eliminating status update meetings"

**AI wrote:** "SaaS platform for businesses"  
**You enhance:** "AI-powered project management SaaS for remote-first companies with 10-100 employees"

### Fill in Blanks

If AI couldn't extract something (blank field), fill it manually:
- Competitors (if not obvious from website)
- Brand Point of View (if not on website)
- TikTok Keywords (AI doesn't generate these)

## Re-Enriching

You can re-enrich anytime:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update Your Website">
    Make changes to website copy
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Enrich' Again">
    In your Brand Kit
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Overwrite">
    Popup warns that existing fields will be replaced
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review New Output">
    AI re-analyzes with latest website content
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Use when:** Website significantly updated

<Warning>
Re-enrichment replaces all manually edited fields. Save your custom descriptions before re-enriching if you want to keep them.
</Warning>

## Enrichment Troubleshooting

### "Enrichment failed" Error

**Causes:**
- Website is down/unreachable
- Website blocks scraping
- No substantial content on website

**Solutions:**
- Check website is online
- Try secondary URL to specific page
- Fill fields manually if website is too minimal

### Generic/Inaccurate Results

**Causes:**
- Website copy is vague
- Multiple products/services confuse AI
- Website is heavy on images, light on text

**Solutions:**
- Point secondary URL to most detailed page
- Manually edit after enrichment
- Add LinkedIn URL for more context

### Missing Competitors

**Cause:** Competitors not mentioned on website

**Solution:** Manually add them after enrichment (click "Add Competitor")

## Enrichment vs Manual Entry

### When to Rely on Enrichment

**Use AI enrichment when:**
- You have a detailed, well-written website
- You want to save time
- Your website copy already matches desired brand voice

### When to Write Manually

**Write manually when:**
- Website is minimal (landing page only)
- Website voice doesn't match TikTok voice
- You're targeting different audience on TikTok vs website
- You have very specific messaging you need

<Tip>
**Best approach:** Enrich first, then manually refine. AI gives you 70% there, you polish to 100%.
</Tip>

## Enrichment Impact on Content

How enriched Brand Kits improve content:

### Before Enrichment (Empty Brand Kit)

**Generated topic:** "3 productivity tips"  
**Content:** Generic productivity advice with stock images

### After Enrichment (Detailed Brand Kit)

**Generated topic:** "3 ways [YourProduct] helps remote teams ship 30% faster"  
**Content:** Specific to your product, mentions features, uses your brand voice, targets your audience

**Difference:** Enrichment transforms generic content into brand-specific content.

## Best Practices

### Enrich Early

Create Brand Kit → Enrich → Then generate content

**Don't:** Generate content with empty Brand Kit, wonder why it's generic

### Don't Over-Enrich

**First enrichment:** When Brand Kit is created  
**Second enrichment:** Only after major website/brand changes

**Why:** Each enrichment overwrites your manual edits. Enrich when necessary, not frequently.

### Validate Extraction

After enrichment, verify AI understood your brand correctly:
- Does tone match?
- Are product descriptions accurate?
- Is audience targeting right?

**If yes:** Great, use it!  
**If no:** Manually edit the misunderstood fields.
