## What Are Brand Assets?

Assets in your Brand Kit serve two purposes:

1. **Profile pictures for branded accounts** - Your logo becomes account avatars
2. **Reference images for content** - Product photos can be used in AI generation

## Uploading Brand Assets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Brand Kit">
    Navigate to Brand Hub → Click your Brand Kit
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scroll to Brand Assets Section">
    Below all brand information fields
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drag and Drop or Click">
    - Drag images directly onto the upload area
    - Or click **Upload Assets** to browse files
  </Step>

  <Step title="Images Upload">
    Assets appear in your Brand Kit library
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported File Types

**Images:**
- PNG (recommended for logos)
- JPG/JPEG
- GIF
- WebP

**Size limits:**
- Max file size: 10MB per image
- Recommended: 1080x1080 or larger
- Logo: 512x512 minimum

## Setting Primary Logo

Your primary logo is used for:
- Branded TikTok account profile pictures
- Brand Kit thumbnail
- Watermarks (optional, future feature)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hover Over Logo Asset">
    In your Brand Assets section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Set as Primary'">
    Star icon or right-click menu
  </Step>

  <Step title="Logo Marked">
    Primary logo shows a star badge
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Use PNG with transparency** for logos. This ensures clean profile pictures on colored backgrounds.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Logo Requirements

**For profile pictures:**
- Square aspect ratio (1:1)
- Transparent background (PNG)
- Simple design (legible at small sizes)
- High contrast

**Good logo examples:**
- Company wordmark on transparent background
- Simple icon/symbol
- Monogram

**Poor logo examples:**
- Full lockup with tagline (too detailed)
- Horizontal layout (gets cropped)
- Light logo on light background (low contrast)

### Product Photos

**For use in content generation:**
- Clean background (preferably white or transparent)
- High resolution (1080p+)
- Multiple angles of same product
- Good lighting

**Upload:**
- 5-10 product photos
- Different products/features
- Lifestyle shots (product in use)

### Brand Graphics

**For reference use:**
- Marketing materials
- Brand guidelines examples
- Instagram posts
- Website screenshots

## Managing Assets

### Viewing Assets

All uploaded assets appear in a grid showing:
- Thumbnail preview
- File name
- Upload date
- Primary status (for logos)

### Removing Assets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hover Over Asset">
    Hover over the asset you want to remove
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click X or Delete">
    Click the X icon or right-click → Delete
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Removal">
    Confirm deletion (permanent)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Removing an asset that's currently used in branded account profiles won't update those accounts. Remove only unused assets.
</Warning>

## Using Assets in Content

Assets can be used two ways:

### Automatic Use (Branded Accounts)

When you create branded TikTok accounts:
- Primary logo is automatically used as profile picture
- No manual action needed

### Manual Use (Content References)

When creating content:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Content Generator">
    Start creating content
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Advanced Settings">
    Click Advanced below topic input
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add References">
    Drag Brand Assets into Image References bucket
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate">
    AI uses those assets in generated content
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Asset Organization

### Asset Count

Brand Kits show total asset count. Recommended:
- **Minimum:** 1 logo
- **Good:** 1 logo + 5 product photos
- **Great:** 1 logo + 10 product photos + 5 brand graphics

### Naming Conventions

Name assets descriptively:
- `logo-primary.png`
- `product-dashboard-screenshot.jpg`
- `team-photo-office.jpg`

**Why:** Makes it easier to find and reference later.

## Advanced Asset Management

### Multiple Logo Variations

Upload different logo versions:
- Primary logo (full color)
- White logo (for dark backgrounds)
- Icon only (for small spaces)
- Monochrome version

**Set the most versatile as primary** (usually full-color on transparent background).

### Product Photo Library

For each product:
- Hero shot (main image)
- Detail shots (features)
- In-use shot (customer using it)
- Lifestyle shot (in environment)

**Use in content generation** by selecting appropriate photos as Image References.

### Brand Style Examples

Upload examples of:
- Best Instagram posts
- Website hero sections
- Marketing campaign visuals

**Use as Style References** when you want content to match existing brand materials.

## Asset Storage & Limits

**Storage per Brand Kit:**
- Up to 50 assets
- 500MB total storage

**Asset optimization:**
- Images are automatically optimized for web
- Multiple sizes generated (small, medium, large)
- Originals are preserved

<Info>
If you need more storage, contact support or use the Assets library (separate from Brand Kits).

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Brand Assets in multiple Brand Kits?">
    No, assets belong to specific Brand Kits. Upload the same asset to multiple Brand Kits if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't have a logo?">
    You can use Brand Kit without assets, but branded accounts will use a generated logo (not ideal). Consider creating a simple text-based logo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I upload videos as assets?">
    Not in Brand Kits. Videos go in the Assets library (separate feature).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do assets affect AI generation?">
    Only if you explicitly use them as references. Simply uploading an asset doesn't automatically include it in content - you must drag it into references during generation.
  </Accordion>
