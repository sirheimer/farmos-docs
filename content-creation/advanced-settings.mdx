## Accessing Advanced Settings

Advanced settings are available during content generation and editing:

  <Step title="Open Content Generator">
    Navigate to Content → Create Content
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Template and Topic">
    Choose your template and topic as normal
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Advanced Settings'">
    Below the topic input, click **Advanced** to expand settings
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Image Mode Settings

**Image Mode** is the most important advanced setting. It controls how AI handles images in your content.

### The Three Image Modes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Original">
    **Use exact images as-is, no modifications**
    
    **What it does:**
    - AI uses template images exactly
    - No edits, no variations
    - Fastest generation time
    
    **Use when:**
    - You have perfect product photos
    - You need photo accuracy (SKUs, exact colors)
    - You uploaded specific reference images to use
    
    **Example scenario:**  
    You have professional product photography and want it to appear exactly as-is in your slideshow.
    
    **Creative Control:** 0
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Edit">
    **AI edits your images to match brand style**
    
    **What it does:**
    - Starts with template or reference images
    - Modifies them to match your brand aesthetic
    - Preserves core subject, changes environment/style
    
    **Use when:**
    - You have product photos but they need enhancement
    - You want brand colors applied to template images
    - You need studio-quality look from basic photos
    
    **Example scenario:**  
    You have a decent product photo but the lighting/background isn't great. AI makes it look professionally shot while keeping your exact product.
    
    **Creative Control:** 0.5 (default)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="New">
    **Generate completely new AI images**
    
    **What it does:**
    - Creates images from scratch
    - No reliance on template images
    - Maximum creative freedom
    
    **Use when:**
    - You don't have photos
    - You want illustrations/graphics
    - You need variety across variations
    
    **Example scenario:**  
    You're creating educational content about productivity and want unique illustrations for each slide, not stock photos.
    
    **Creative Control:** 1.0
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Image Mode Visual Examples

**Scenario: Product showcase for a SaaS tool**

**Original Mode:**
- Slide shows your exact dashboard screenshot
- No edits, perfect accuracy
- ✅ Use for: Demo videos, feature showcases

**Edit Mode:**
- Starts with your dashboard screenshot
- AI enhances lighting, adds polish, matches brand colors
- Dashboard layout stays same, visual quality improves
- ✅ Use for: Product marketing videos

**New Mode:**
- AI generates illustration of a dashboard
- Inspired by your brand but not your exact UI
- ✅ Use for: Concept videos, high-level overviews

<Warning>
**Image Mode can't be changed after generation.** Choose carefully before generating content.
</Warning>

## Creative Control Slider

Fine-tune how closely AI follows the template vs your brand.

### The Slider Scale

```
0 ──────────── 0.5 ──────────── 1.0
Conservative   Balanced        Creative
```

### Creative Control: 0 (Conservative)

**What happens:**
- Stays very close to template
- Minimal brand customization
- Uses template colors/fonts mostly

**Use when:**
- Template already matches your brand
- You want consistency across all content
- You're using "Original" image mode

**Pros:** Fast, predictable, template-faithful  
**Cons:** Less brand personality

### Creative Control: 0.5 (Balanced) - RECOMMENDED

**What happens:**
- Blend of template + brand
- Applies your brand colors
- Uses your fonts when appropriate
- Maintains template structure

**Use when:**
- Most content (default setting)
- You want brand consistency + template structure
- You're using "Edit" image mode

**Pros:** Best of both worlds  
**Cons:** None - this is the sweet spot

### Creative Control: 1.0 (Creative)

**What happens:**
- Maximum brand customization
- Heavy use of brand colors/fonts
- Most deviation from template
- Longer generation time

**Use when:**
- You have very specific brand guidelines
- Template is just a starting point
- You're using "New" image mode

**Pros:** Most on-brand  
**Cons:** Can stray from template's proven structure

## Advanced Toggles

### Keep Background Static

<Accordion title="What it does">
Prevents AI from changing background elements across slides.

**Enabled:**
- All slides share same background
- Only foreground elements change
- Creates cohesive look

**Disabled (default):**
- Each slide can have different background
- More visual variety
- Better for holding attention

**Use when:** You want minimalist, consistent aesthetic across all slides.
</Accordion>

### Prioritize User Uploads

<Accordion title="What it does">
Forces AI to use your reference images prominently.

**Enabled:**
- Reference images appear larger/more prominent
- Template images are secondary
- Your photos are the focus

**Disabled (default):**
- Reference images blend with template
- Balanced composition

**Use when:** You uploaded product photos that MUST be the hero of each slide.
</Accordion>

## When to Use Advanced Settings

### Beginners: Stick to Defaults

For your first 10-20 pieces of content:
- Image Mode: **Edit**
- Creative Control: **0.5**
- Toggles: **Off**
- References: **None**

**Why:** Learn the system before optimizing.

### Intermediate: Test Image Modes

After 20+ pieces:
- Try **Original** mode for product content
- Try **New** mode for educational content
- Compare performance data

### Advanced: Fine-Tune Everything

After 50+ pieces and clear data:
- Dial in Creative Control based on what performs
- Use References extensively
- Create brand-specific presets

## Advanced Settings by Content Type

| Content Type | Image Mode | Creative Control | Toggles |
|--------------|------------|------------------|---------|
| Product demo | Original | 0 | Prioritize Uploads ON |
| Educational | New | 0.5 | All OFF |
| Brand story | Edit | 1.0 | Keep Background Static ON |
| Thought leadership | New | 0.5 | All OFF |
| Feature showcase | Edit | 0.5 | Prioritize Uploads ON |

## Presets (Coming Soon)

In future updates, you'll be able to:
- Save advanced setting combinations as presets
- Quick-load settings for different content types
- Share presets with team members

## Troubleshooting Advanced Settings

### Generation is Taking Too Long

**Cause:** High Creative Control + New Image Mode + References  
**Solution:** Lower Creative Control to 0.5 or use Edit mode

### Images Don't Look Like Brand

**Cause:** Creative Control too low or wrong Image Mode  
**Solution:** Increase Creative Control to 0.7-1.0, use Edit or New mode

### Content Too Different From Template

**Cause:** Creative Control too high  
**Solution:** Lower to 0.3-0.5

### My Product Photo Isn't Showing

**Cause:** Not using references or Prioritize Uploads is off  
**Solution:** Upload as Image Reference and enable Prioritize Uploads toggle

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

Don't overwhelm yourself with all settings at once:

**Week 1-2:** Use defaults  
**Week 3-4:** Experiment with Image Modes  
**Month 2:** Add Creative Control adjustments  
**Month 3:** Master References + Toggles

### Document What Works

Keep notes on settings that work for different content types:
- Product content: Original mode, Control 0
- Educational: New mode, Control 0.5
- Brand content: Edit mode, Control 0.8

### A/B Test Settings

Create same topic twice with different settings:
- Version A: Edit mode, Control 0.5
- Version B: New mode, Control 1.0

Post to different accounts, compare results after 7 days.
