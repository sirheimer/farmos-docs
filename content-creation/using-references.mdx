## What Are Reference Images?

Reference images tell the AI: "Use this as inspiration for the content you're creating."

Unlike simply uploading images to use in slides, references **guide the generation process** to match your desired style, elements, or mood.

<Info>
**Think of references like showing examples to a designer:** "I want it to look like this" or "Include this element in the design."
</Info>

## The Three Reference Types

Juice uses a **three-bucket system** inspired by Midjourney:

### Image References (Elements Bucket)

**What they do:** Specific elements or objects to include in the generated content

**Use when:**
- You have product photos to incorporate
- You want specific objects/items in slides
- You need precise visual elements

**Example use cases:**
- Upload your product → AI incorporates it into slides
- Upload logo → AI places it appropriately
- Upload team photo → AI includes team members

**Limit:** 4 image references max

<Accordion title="Image References Example">
**Scenario:** You're creating content about your SaaS dashboard

**Upload:** Screenshot of your dashboard  
**Prompt:** "Show our dashboard interface in slides 2-4"  
**Result:** AI generates slides featuring your actual dashboard

**vs. without reference:** AI would generate a generic dashboard illustration
</Accordion>

### Style References (Aesthetic Bucket)

**What they do:** Visual style, mood, and aesthetic inspiration

**Use when:**
- You want a specific visual aesthetic
- You're going for a certain mood/vibe
- You want to match existing brand materials

**Example use cases:**
- Upload minimalist design → AI matches that clean aesthetic
- Upload neon-lit photos → AI creates moody, dark content
- Upload pastel images → AI uses soft, gentle color palettes

**Limit:** 4 style references max

<Accordion title="Style References Example">
**Scenario:** You want your content to have a "dark, premium, tech-forward" aesthetic

**Upload:** 2-3 photos of premium tech products with dark backgrounds  
**Prompt:** "Use the moody, high-end aesthetic from the style references"  
**Result:** AI generates content with dark backgrounds, dramatic lighting, and premium feel

**vs. without reference:** AI would use default bright, energetic TikTok style
</Accordion>

### Omni Reference (Complete Style Transfer)

**What it does:** "Make it look EXACTLY like this image"

**Use when:**
- You have one perfect reference image
- You want complete style replication
- You're matching existing content

**Example use cases:**
- Upload competitor video frame → AI matches that style
- Upload brand campaign visual → AI replicates aesthetic
- Upload viral post → AI captures that vibe

**Limit:** 1 omni reference (it's powerful!)

<Accordion title="Omni Reference Example">
**Scenario:** You saw a viral TikTok with the perfect aesthetic for your brand

**Upload:** Screenshot from that TikTok  
**Prompt:** "Match the overall look and feel of this reference"  
**Result:** Your content adopts the layout, color scheme, styling, and vibe of that reference

**vs. without reference:** AI uses standard template styling
</Accordion>

## How to Add References

### During Initial Generation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Advanced Settings">
    Click **Advanced** below topic input
  </Step>

  <Step title="Expand References Section">
    Scroll down to see three reference dropzones:
    - **Image** (Elements)
    - **Style** (Aesthetic)
    - **Omni** (Complete)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drag and Drop Images">
    Drop images into the appropriate bucket:
    - Product photos → Image bucket
    - Aesthetic inspiration → Style bucket
    - Complete reference → Omni bucket
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate with References">
    Click topic to generate. AI uses your references to guide creation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### During Editing

You can also add references when editing existing content:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Image Icon">
    In the editing interface, click the image icon below your edit prompt
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload References">
    References section expands. Upload images to any bucket.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Edit Prompt">
    "Use the images from my references to update slides 2-4"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Edit">
    AI regenerates those slides using your references
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reference Best Practices

### Image Quality Matters

**Good reference images:**
- ✅ High resolution (1080p+)
- ✅ Clear subject/focus
- ✅ Good lighting
- ✅ Simple, clean background

**Poor reference images:**
- ❌ Low resolution/blurry
- ❌ Multiple subjects (unclear focus)
- ❌ Dark or poorly lit
- ❌ Busy background with distractions

### Match References to Image Mode

| Image Mode | Best Reference Type |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Original** | Image References (your exact photos) |
| **Edit** | Image + Style References (guide edits) |
| **New** | Style References (mood/aesthetic only) |

### Use Multiple References Strategically

**Don't:** Upload 4 completely different style references  
**Do:** Upload 4 references with consistent aesthetic

**Why:** Conflicting references confuse the AI. Cohesive references reinforce the desired style.

### Reference + Prompt Combination

References work best when paired with descriptive prompts:

**Weak:** Just upload image, no prompt  
**Strong:** Upload image + "Use the clean, minimalist style from the reference"

**Stronger:** Upload image + "Apply the dark moody lighting from style reference 1 and incorporate the product from image reference 1"

## Advanced Reference Techniques

### Layering References

Combine multiple reference types for precision:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Image Reference">
    Upload your product photo
  </Step>

  <Step title="Style Reference">
    Upload aesthetic inspiration (premium, minimalist, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prompt">
    "Create slides showing [image reference product] with the aesthetic of [style references]"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Your product rendered in your desired aesthetic.

### Moving References Between Buckets

Changed your mind about bucket placement?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag Reference">
    Click and hold a reference image
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drop in New Bucket">
    Drag to different bucket (Image → Style or vice versa)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Use when:** You realize an image works better as style inspiration than as an element to include.

### Slide-Specific References

Target references to specific slides:

**In your prompt:**
- "Use image reference 1 on slide 2"
- "Apply style reference 2 to slides 4-6"
- "Use omni reference only on the final slide"

**Right:** Upload images to guide what AI generates

References are **inspiration**, not direct content.

**Wrong:** Upload minimalist aesthetics + maximalist aesthetics  
**Right:** Upload references with consistent visual language

### ❌ Not Describing Reference Intent

**Wrong:** Upload images with no prompt  
**Right:** Upload images + prompt explaining how to use them

### ❌ Using Low-Quality References

**Wrong:** Upload blurry screenshots or compressed images  
**Right:** Upload high-res, clear images

    Hover over the reference image in its bucket
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click X">
    Click the X icon in the top-right
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reference Removed">
    Image is deleted and won't be used in generation
  </Step>
