## Advanced Editing Techniques

### Editing Specific Slides

Target edits to specific slides by number:

**Examples:**
- "On slide 3, make the text white instead of black"
- "Change the image on slides 2 and 4 to show our product in use"
- "Make slide 1's background darker for better contrast"

### Combining Edit Types

You can chain multiple edits:

**Flow:**
1. Edit images first
2. Then edit text to match new images
3. Then edit style for polish

Each edit builds on the previous one.

### Iteration Tracking

Juice tracks every edit you make:
- View iteration history
- See what prompts you used
- Understand how content evolved

## Adding Slides

Insert new slides anywhere in your slideshow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Slides'">
    Opens the add slide interface
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Insert Position">
    Click between slides where you want to insert the new one:
    - Before slide 1
    - Between any slides
    - After last slide
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe New Slide">
    Write what the new slide should contain:
    
    **Example:** "Add a slide showing our pricing tiers"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate New Slide">
    AI creates the slide and inserts it at your chosen position
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**New slides match your template's style automatically.** They'll blend seamlessly with existing slides.
</Info>

## Removing Slides

Delete slides you don't need.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Remove a Slide'">
    Opens slide removal interface
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Slides to Remove">
    Click slides you want to delete. They'll turn red.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Removal">
    Click **Remove Selected Slides**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Removing slides is permanent for this iteration. You can't undo it (but you can regenerate the entire content if needed).
</Warning>

## Reordering Slides

Rearrange slide order with drag-and-drop.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Reorder Slides'">
    Opens reorder interface showing all slides
  </Step>

  <Step title="Drag and Drop">
    Click and hold a slide, then drag it to new position:
    - Move slide 5 to position 2
    - Swap slide order
    - Reorganize flow
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm New Order">
    Click **Save New Order** when you're happy with the arrangement
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to Reorder

Reorder slides when:
- The flow doesn't make logical sense
- You want hook/CTA in different positions
- Testing different slide sequences

## Edit Best Practices

### Keep Edits Simple

**Good edits:**
- "Make the background darker"
- "Change slide 2's headline to 'Save 10 hours per week'"
- "Use warmer colors"

**Problematic edits:**
- "Completely redesign everything to look like Apple's style with different images and new text that's more engaging but also professional"

**Why:** Simple, focused edits work better. Complex multi-part edits can confuse the AI.

### Edit One Thing at a Time

**Flow:**
1. Edit images first (get visuals right)
2. Then edit text (match messaging to visuals)
3. Finally edit style (polish the aesthetic)

**Why:** Each edit builds context. Editing everything at once makes it harder to know what changed.

### Preview Before Approving

After edits:
- Click through all slides
- Watch the auto-preview
- Make sure animations still work
- Verify text is readable

## How Many Edits Are Normal?

| User Type | Typical Edits |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Beginner** | 3-5 edits per content |
| **Experienced** | 1-2 edits per content |
| **Power User** | 0 edits (trust AI more) |

<Info>
As you get better at writing topics and choosing templates, you'll need fewer edits. Most users start with 3-4 edits and drop to 1-2 within a month.

## Editing Keyboard Shortcuts

## Common Editing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Wrong Tone

**Problem:** Content is too casual, you need professional tone  
**Solution:** Select all slides, prompt: "Rewrite all text in a more professional, business-appropriate tone"

### Scenario 2: Generic Images

**Problem:** Images don't show your actual product  
**Solution:** Upload product photo as Image Reference, prompt: "Replace generic product images with the reference image I uploaded"

### Scenario 3: Weak Hook

**Problem:** First slide doesn't grab attention  
**Solution:** Select slide 1, prompt: "Rewrite the hook to start with a surprising statistic about productivity"

### Scenario 4: Too Long

**Problem:** Video has 10 slides, feels too slow  
**Solution:** Remove slides 7-9 to tighten the flow

### Scenario 5: Needs Context

**Problem:** Missing a key explanatory slide  
**Solution:** Add slide between slides 3 and 4: "Add a slide explaining why this matters for remote teams"
