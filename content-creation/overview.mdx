## What is the Content Generator?

The Content Generator is an AI-powered tool that creates slideshow-style TikTok videos:

- **Input:** A template + a topic (e.g., "3 ways to improve team productivity")
- **Output:** A complete video with images, text overlays, and animations
- **Time:** 15-30 seconds to generate

### What You Get

Each generated piece of content includes:
- **6-10 slides** (varies by template)
- **Unique images** for each slide (AI-generated or from your references)
- **Text overlays** formatted to match the template
- **Animations** optimized for viewer retention
- **Real-time preview** on a phone mockup

## Time Investment

How long does content creation actually take?

| Task | Time | Frequency |
|------|------|-----------|
| Generate 1 content piece | 2 min | As needed |
| Edit 1 content piece | 5-10 min | Per piece |
| Batch create 10 pieces | 30-40 min | Weekly |
| Review and approve | 2 min | Per piece |

**Typical weekly workflow:** 60 minutes to create and approve 10 content pieces = enough for 6 accounts posting 2x/day for 1 week.

<Tip>
**Batch content creation works well.** Set aside 1 hour on Monday to create all content for the week.
</Tip>

## What Makes Great AI-Generated Content?

The AI is powerful, but you guide it. Here's what separates good from great:

### Great AI Prompts

**Topic prompts that work:**
- Clear and specific
- Include target outcome
- Mention audience if relevant

**Examples:**
- ✅ "How CFOs can cut software costs by 30% without losing functionality"
- ✅ "3 mistakes first-time founders make when hiring engineers"
- ❌ "Software tips"
- ❌ "Hiring advice"

### Great Reference Images

**What works:**
- High-resolution (1080p+)
- Clear subject
- Good lighting
- Minimal background clutter

**What doesn't:**
- Screenshots with UI elements
- Blurry phone photos
- Busy backgrounds
- Low-resolution images

## Content Library Management

As you create and approve content, it builds your library:

### Approved Content Library

Access all approved content from **Content** in the sidebar:
- View all variations
- See which accounts it's assigned to
- Edit settings (posting frequency, active/inactive)
- Duplicate to create new versions

### Content Organization

Best practices for staying organized:
- Use clear topic descriptions when generating
- Tag content by template type
- Review performance monthly and archive low performers
