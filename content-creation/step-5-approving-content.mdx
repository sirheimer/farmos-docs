## What "Approve" Does

When you click **Approve Content**, three things happen:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locks Your Base Design">
    Your current slides become the "master" template for this content piece. All edits are finalized.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generates Variations">
    AI creates 10+ unique variations of your content:
    - Same structure and message
    - Different images for each variation
    - Different text execution
    - Same visual style
    
    **Generation time:** ~30-60 seconds for all variations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Saves to Content Library">
    Your approved content (master + variations) is saved to your Content Library where you can:
    - Assign to accounts
    - View analytics
    - Edit settings
    - Duplicate or archive
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Variations

Variations are the key to multi-account success. Here's how they work:

### Why Variations Matter

TikTok's algorithm detects duplicate content. If you post the same video from multiple accounts, it flags them as spam.

**Variations solve this:**
- Account 1 posts Variation A
- Account 2 posts Variation B  
- Account 3 posts Variation C

Each variation is unique enough to avoid duplication flags, but similar enough to test the same content concept.

### What's Different in Each Variation?

| Element | Same Across Variations | Different in Each Variation |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Slide structure | ✅ Same number of slides | ❌ - |
| Message/topic | ✅ Same core message | ❌ - |
| Visual style | ✅ Same template style | ❌ - |
| Text wording | ❌ - | ✅ Different phrasing |
| Images | ❌ - | ✅ Different images |
| Animations | ✅ Same timing | ❌ - |

**Example:**

**Master Content:** "3 Ways to Improve Team Productivity"

**Variation A:**
- Slide 1: "Your team is wasting 10 hours a week"
- Slide 2: Image of cluttered desk

**Variation B:**
- Slide 1: "Most teams work 10 extra hours for no reason"
- Slide 2: Image of stressed worker

**Variation C:**
- Slide 1: "Here's how top teams save 10 hours weekly"
- Slide 2: Image of organized workspace

Same concept, unique execution.

## The Approval Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Your Content">
    Before approving, do a final check:
    - Click through all slides
    - Watch the auto-preview
    - Verify text accuracy
    - Check image quality
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Approve Content'">
    Big green button at the bottom
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch Variation Generation">
    You'll see a burst animation while AI creates variations
    
    **Time:** ~30-60 seconds
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Account Assignment">
    After variations generate, you automatically move to the account selection screen
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You Can't Do After Approval

Once approved, you can't:
- Edit the master content (it's locked)
- Change slide structure
- Modify variations individually

### But You CAN:

- **Duplicate** the content and edit the copy
- **Change content settings** (posting frequency, active/inactive)
- **Assign to more accounts**
- **View performance analytics**

<Info>
Think of approval as "publishing" your content template. You can always create a new version by duplicating.
</Info>

## Approval Without Edits

Don't need to edit? You can approve immediately after generation:

1. Review generated content
2. Looks good? Click **Approve Content**
3. Skip straight to variations

**Most experienced users approve 60-70% of content without any edits.**

## Approval Settings

During approval, you can configure:

### Variation Level

- **Conservative** - Variations stay very close to master (3-5% different)
- **Moderate** - Balanced difference (10-15% different) **← Recommended**
- **Creative** - More variation (20-30% different)

<Warning>
Higher variation levels create more unique content but risk straying from your intended message. Start with Moderate.
</Warning>

### Number of Variations

Currently set to 10-15 variations per approval. This ensures:
- Enough unique content for 10+ accounts
- Testing capacity with different executions
- Buffer for underperforming variations

## What Happens to Variations?

After generation, each variation is:

1. **Stored in your Content Library** - View from Content page
2. **Available for assignment** - Assign specific variations to specific accounts
3. **Tracked separately** - Each variation has its own analytics

### Viewing Variations

From your Content Library:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Content Page">
    Click **Content** in sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your Approved Content">
    You'll see your content listed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click to View Details">
    See all variations, assignments, and performance
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Approval Workflow

Once content is approved, you have two paths:

### Path 1: Assign Immediately

Most common flow:
1. Approve content
2. Auto-navigate to account selection
3. Choose accounts
4. Confirm assignment
5. Content starts posting (after warmup)

### Path 2: Save for Later

Maybe you want to batch assignments:
1. Approve content
2. Skip account assignment
3. Content saved to library
4. Assign later from Content page

Both approaches work. Choose based on your workflow preference.

## Approval Best Practices

### Don't Over-Think It

**Good enough is better than perfect.** If content is 80% there, approve it. You can always create another version later.

### Approve in Batches

**Efficient workflow:**
1. Generate 5 content pieces back-to-back
2. Review all 5
3. Edit the 1-2 that need changes
4. Approve all 5
5. Batch-assign to accounts

**Time saved:** ~30 minutes vs. doing one-at-a-time

### Track What You Approve

Keep notes on what topics/templates you've approved. After 30 days, review performance and create more of what works.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit content after approval?">
    No, approved content is locked. But you can **duplicate** it to create an editable copy, then make changes and approve the new version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many variations should I create?">
    The default (10-15) works for most users. Only increase if you have 15+ accounts that need this content.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see variations before assigning?">
    Yes! From the Content page, click your approved content to preview all variations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't like a variation?">
    You can choose specific variations to assign. Just skip the ones you don't want.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do variations count against my quota?">
    No. Approving 1 content with 10 variations counts as 1 approved content, not 10.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What Happens Next?

After approval completes:
1. You're directed to account selection
2. Choose which accounts get this content
3. Content begins posting (after warmup)
