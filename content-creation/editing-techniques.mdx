## Advanced Editing Patterns

### Pattern 1: Slide-Specific Targeting

Edit individual slides with precision:

**General edit:**
```
"Make the images more vibrant"
```
**Applies to:** All selected slides

**Targeted edit:**
```
"On slide 3, replace the illustration with a photo of someone using a laptop. On slide 5, make the background gradient instead of solid."
```
**Applies to:** Specific slides only

### Pattern 2: Comparative Editing

Reference other slides when editing:

**Examples:**
- "Make slide 4 match the style of slide 1"
- "Use the same background from slide 2 on slides 3-5"
- "Keep slide 1's font but make it larger on other slides"

### Pattern 3: Conditional Editing

Use "if/then" logic in prompts:

**Examples:**
- "If there's a person in the image, make them more prominent"
- "On slides with products, ensure product is centered"
- "For slides with text-heavy copy, use a simpler background"

### Pattern 4: Style Chaining

Make multiple small edits in sequence:

**Step 1:** "Darken all backgrounds"  
**Step 2:** "Make text white for better contrast"  
**Step 3:** "Add subtle gradient to backgrounds"  
**Step 4:** "Increase text size 20%"

Each edit builds on the previous. **Result:** Cohesive, polished transformation.

## Editing with References

### Technique 1: Reference-Guided Image Edit

**Setup:**
- Upload product photo to Image References
- Select slides 2, 4, 6 (product slides)

**Prompt:**
"Replace the placeholder product with my actual product from the image reference. Match the lighting and angle from the reference."

**Result:** Your exact product, perfectly integrated into template style.

### Technique 2: Style Transfer Edit

**Setup:**
- Upload 3 photos with dark, moody aesthetic to Style References
- Select all slides

**Prompt:**
"Apply the dark, cinematic style from my style references. Keep all text and layout, just change the mood."

**Result:** Same content, dramatically different aesthetic.

### Technique 3: Omni-Guided Regeneration

**Setup:**
- Upload perfect reference to Omni bucket
- Select all slides

**Prompt:**
"Regenerate this entire slideshow to match the aesthetic of the omni reference while keeping my topic and message."

**Result:** Complete visual overhaul while preserving content.

## Editing Don'ts

### ❌ Don't Over-Edit

**Problem:** Making 10+ edits trying to achieve perfection  
**Better:** Generate new content if you're that far off

After 3-4 edits, you're probably better off regenerating with a different template or better initial settings.

### ❌ Don't Edit Without Previewing

**Problem:** Editing blind without checking results  
**Better:** Preview after each edit to verify direction

Always click through slides after an edit to ensure it worked as expected.

### ❌ Don't Use Vague Prompts

**Vague:** "Make it better"  
**Specific:** "Make the headline larger and change the background to solid black"

AI needs specific direction.

### ❌ Don't Fight the Template

**Problem:** Trying to completely transform template structure through editing  
**Better:** Choose a different template that's closer to your vision

Templates have inherent structure. Work with it, don't fight it.

## Editing Shortcuts & Tips

### Batch Slide Selection

**Quick select:**
- **Odd slides:** Click 1, 3, 5, 7
- **Even slides:** Click 2, 4, 6, 8
- **Range:** Shift+Click first and last to select range

**Use for:** Applying consistent changes to alternate slides.
