## The Generation Process

Content generation typically takes **15-30 seconds** and happens in real-time on your screen.

###What the AI Does

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyzes Your Inputs">
    - Template structure (slide count, layout)
    - Your topic
    - Brand Kit (voice, colors, style)
    - Any reference images you uploaded
  </Step>

  <Step title="Creates Slide Content">
    For each slide:
    - Writes text copy that matches your brand voice
    - Generates or selects images
    - Applies template styling (fonts, colors, layout)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Renders Preview">
    Slides appear sequentially in the phone mockup on the right:
    - Slide 1 appears first
    - Then slide 2
    - Then slide 3
    - And so on...
  </Step>

  <Step title="Completion">
    Once all slides are generated, you can review, edit, or approve.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What You'll See During Generation

### Phone Preview Updates

The phone mockup on the right side of the screen shows your content in real-time:

- **Loading state** - Phone shows "Generating..."
- **Slide 1 appears** - First slide renders
- **Slide 2 appears** - Second slide renders
- **Auto-preview** - Once complete, preview auto-plays through all slides

### Generation Progress

You'll see:
- Loading spinner
- "Generating content..." message
- Slide-by-slide population

<Info>
**Can't see the phone preview?** It's hidden on mobile devices. You'll see the slides in a vertical list instead.
</Info>

## Generation Time Factors

| Factor | Time Impact |
|--------|-------------|
| **Slide count** | More slides = longer (1-2 sec per slide) |
| **Image complexity** | Complex images take longer to generate |
| **Reference images** | Processing uploads adds 5-10 seconds |
| **Creative control setting** | Higher creativity = longer generation |

**Typical generation times:**
- Simple 6-slide content: ~15 seconds
- Complex 10-slide content: ~30 seconds
- Content with references: ~25-35 seconds

## What Can Go Wrong?

### Generation Errors

Occasionally, generation might fail. Common reasons:

**"DNA not extracted"**
- This template hasn't been fully analyzed yet
- **Solution:** Try a different template or contact support

**"Generation timeout"**
- Topic was too complex or ambiguous
- **Solution:** Simplify your topic or break it into parts

**"Invalid template"**
- Template is no longer available
- **Solution:** Select a different template

<Warning>
If generation fails, you won't be charged. Simply try again with a different topic or template.
</Warning>

## Reviewing Generated Content

Once generation completes:

###Phone Preview Navigation

- **Click slides** - Jump to specific slides
- **Arrow keys** - Navigate with keyboard (←/→)
- **Auto-play** - Preview plays through automatically

### What to Check

Go through each slide and verify:

✅ **Text is accurate** - No factual errors  
✅ **Images match content** - Visuals support the message  
✅ **Brand aligned** - Tone and style match your brand  
✅ **Flow makes sense** - Slides progress logically  

## Your Options After Generation

## Generation Performance Tips

### Speed Up Generation

Want faster results?

- **Use fewer reference images** - Each reference adds processing time
- **Choose simpler templates** - Fewer slides = faster generation
- **Set Creative Control to 0.5** - Balanced setting is fastest

### Improve Quality

Want better initial results?

- **Write detailed topics** - More context = better content
- **Use Image Mode "Edit"** - Blends your brand better than "New"
- **Upload reference images** - Guides AI more precisely

## What Gets Generated?

Here's exactly what you receive after generation:

### For Each Slide

- **Background image** - AI-generated or from template
- **Foreground elements** - Icons, illustrations, product images
- **Text overlay** - Headline and/or body text
- **Styling** - Colors, fonts, layout from template + brand

### Metadata

- **Content topic** - Your selected/written topic
- **Template used** - Which template was applied
- **Brand Kit** - Which brand this belongs to
- **Iteration history** - Tracking for edits

## Regenerating Content

Don't like the result? You can regenerate:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go Back to Topics">
    Click **← Back** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Same Topic Again">
    Select the exact same topic
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get New Generation">
    AI creates a completely new version with different images and text execution
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** The same topic can generate different results each time. If you like the topic but not the execution, just regenerate!
</Tip>

## Generation with References

If you uploaded reference images (in Advanced Settings), the AI uses them during generation:

- **Image References** - AI incorporates these specific images into slides
- **Style References** - AI matches the aesthetic/mood of these images
- **Omni Reference** - AI does complete style transfer

[→ Learn more about references](/content-creation/using-references)

## Generation with Advanced Settings

If you adjusted Advanced Settings before generating:

- **Image Mode "Original"** - AI uses template images as-is (fastest)
- **Image Mode "Edit"** - AI edits images to match your brand
- **Image Mode "New"** - AI generates completely new images (slowest, most creative)
- **Creative Control** - Higher values = more brand customization

[→ Learn more about advanced settings](/content-creation/advanced-settings)

## What Happens Next?

After generation completes, you can:
1. Review the content in the phone preview
2. Edit any slides that need changes
3. Approve the content to create variations
4. Assign to accounts for posting

Most users either:
- **Approve immediately** (if content looks great)
- **Make 1-2 quick edits** then approve
