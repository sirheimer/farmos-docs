## The Account Assignment Screen

After approving content, you see all your accounts with checkboxes. Each account shows:

- **Profile picture** and **username**
- **Account type** (Branded, Faceless, UGC)
- **Current status** (Warming Up, Posting, etc.)
- **Platform** (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)
- **View count** and performance stats

## Manual Account Selection

Select specific accounts for this content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Available Accounts">
    Scroll through your account list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Accounts">
    Click checkboxes next to accounts you want to use
    
    **Selected accounts** show a blue checkmark
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Assignment">
    Click **Assign to X Accounts** button at bottom
  </Step>

  <Step title="Content Begins Posting">
    Each selected account will:
    - Receive a unique variation
    - Start posting (after warmup completes)
    - Post on your set schedule (1-3x per day)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Selection Strategies

**Spread across account types:**
- 3 branded accounts
- 2 faceless accounts
- 1 UGC account

**Focus on one type:**
- All 6 branded accounts
- (Good for brand awareness campaigns)

**Test account types:**
- Same content to 2 branded + 2 faceless
- Compare performance after 7 days

## AI Auto-Select

Let Juice's AI choose the best accounts for your content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'AI Auto-Select'">
    Button above the account list
  </Step>

  <Step title="AI Analyzes Matches">
    AI considers:
    - Content topic vs account persona
    - Account performance history
    - Account current workload
    - Brand fit
    
    **Analysis time:** ~5-10 seconds
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Recommendations">
    AI pre-selects recommended accounts. You'll see:
    - Why each account was selected
    - Confidence score for the match
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust if Needed">
    You can uncheck or add accounts after AI selection
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Assignment">
    Click **Assign to X Accounts**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### When to Use AI Auto-Select

**Use AI auto-select when:**
- You have 10+ accounts and manual selection is tedious
- You're not sure which accounts fit the content
- You want optimization based on performance data

**Manually select when:**
- You have a specific strategy (all branded accounts)
- You're testing account types
- You want specific accounts for a campaign

<Tip>
**Try this:** Use AI auto-select, then adjust ±1-2 accounts based on your strategy. Best of both worlds!
</Tip>

## Account Status Considerations

Not all accounts can post immediately:

### Account Status: Posting ✅

**Can assign:** Yes  
**Will post:** Immediately (based on schedule)  
**Best for:** Timely content that needs to go out now

### Account Status: Warming Up 🔥

**Can assign:** Yes  
**Will post:** After warmup completes (3-7 days)  
**Best for:** Evergreen content that isn't time-sensitive

### Account Status: Pending ⏳

**Can assign:** Yes  
**Will post:** After setup + warmup complete  
**Best for:** Content you're planning ahead

### Account Status: Archived 📦

**Can assign:** No  
**Why:** Archived accounts don't post

<Info>
**Assigning to warming accounts is fine!** Content will queue and start posting automatically once warmup completes.
</Info>

## Posting Frequency Settings

When assigning, you can set how often each account posts this content:

| Frequency | Posts Per Week | Best For |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **1x per day** | 7 posts | Conservative start |
| **2x per day** | 14 posts | Balanced growth |
| **3x per day** | 21 posts | Maximum reach |

### Frequency Recommendations

**New accounts (Week 1-2):** 1x per day  
**Established accounts (Week 3+):** 2x per day  
**High-performing accounts:** 3x per day  

<Warning>
Don't immediately set all accounts to 3x per day. Start conservatively (1x) and scale up as accounts prove they can handle more content without quality drops.
</Warning>

## Assignment Confirmation

After clicking **Assign to Accounts**, you'll see a confirmation showing:

- Number of accounts selected
- Posting frequency
- Estimated reach (views per week)

Confirm to finalize the assignment.

## What Happens After Assignment?

Once assigned, each account:

1. **Receives a unique variation** - No two accounts post the same video
2. **Queues content for posting** - Joins the posting schedule
3. **Begins posting** - Based on your frequency setting
4. **Rotates through content** - If account has multiple content pieces assigned

### Posting Schedule

**Example with 1x per day:**
- Day 1: Posts variation A
- Day 2: Posts different content (if multiple assigned)
- Day 3: Rotates back to variation A (or next in queue)

### Viewing Assigned Content

From the account detail page:
- See all assigned content
- View posting schedule
- Check what's queued next

## Managing Assignments

### Add More Accounts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Content Page">
    Click **Content** in sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your Content">
    Click the approved content piece
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Assign to More Accounts'">
    Select additional accounts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    New accounts start receiving this content
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Remove Account Assignments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Content Detail">
    Click **Content** → Your content piece
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Assigned Accounts">
    See list of accounts currently assigned
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Remove">
    Remove specific accounts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Removal">
    Account stops posting this content
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Pause Content

Don't want to post this content anymore but don't want to delete it?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Content Detail">
    Navigate to the content piece
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle 'Active' Switch">
    Turn content to Inactive
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Effect:** All assigned accounts pause posting this content (but assignment remains).

## Account Selection Best Practices

### Match Content to Account Persona

| Content Type | Best Account Type |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Brand story, company values | Branded accounts |
| Educational, tips & tricks | Faceless accounts |
| Personal insights, relatability | UGC accounts |
| Product features | Branded + Faceless |

### Don't Overload Accounts

Each account can handle 3-5 active content pieces comfortably.

**If assigning 3x per day:**
- 3-4 content pieces = good rotation
- 10+ content pieces = might not post all regularly

**Monitor:** If an account has 8+ content pieces, consider reducing or creating more accounts.

### Spread Content Across Account Types

**Instead of:** Assigning all content to your 6 branded accounts  
**Try:** Distribute across branded, faceless, and UGC accounts

**Why:** Tests which account types perform best with your content.

## Skipping Account Assignment

You can skip assignment and assign later:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'Skip for Now'">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Later">

  </Step>
</Steps>

**Use when:**
- You're batch-creating content
