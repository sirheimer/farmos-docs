## AI Topic Suggestions

After selecting a template, Juice's AI automatically generates 5-8 topic suggestions tailored to:
- Your selected template
- Your Brand Kit (product, audience, voice)
- Current trending themes in your niche

### How AI Generates Topics

The AI analyzes:
1. **Your Brand Kit** - What you sell, who you target
2. **Template DNA** - What format works for this template
3. **TikTok Keywords** - Your niche targeting settings
4. **Industry Trends** - What's performing in your space

**Example:** If your Brand Kit says you sell project management software to remote teams, and you selected the "3 Ways" template, AI might suggest:

- "3 ways to keep remote teams aligned without endless meetings"
- "3 features that make async work actually work"
- "3 mistakes managers make with distributed teams"

  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Makes a Good Custom Topic?

**Good topics are:**
- Specific and actionable
- Audience-focused (solve a problem)
- Matched to your template structure

**Examples:**

**For "3 Ways" Template:**
- ✅ "3 ways SaaS companies reduce churn by 20%"
- ✅ "3 copywriting mistakes killing your landing page"
- ❌ "Ways to improve" (too vague)
- ❌ "How to write better copy" (doesn't fit "3 Ways" structure)

**For "Problem/Solution" Template:**
- ✅ "Remote teams waste 10 hours/week in meetings - here's the fix"
- ✅ "Your sales team is losing deals in email - here's why"
- ❌ "Marketing tips" (no clear problem stated)
- ❌ "How we built our product" (not problem/solution format)

**For "How To" Template:**
- ✅ "How to write cold emails that get 40% response rates"
- ✅ "How to audit your SaaS pricing in 15 minutes"
- ❌ "Email marketing" (not instructional)
- ❌ "Everything about pricing" (too broad)

### Topic Formula

Follow this formula for any template:

**[Template Structure] + [Specific Outcome] + [Audience Context]**

**Examples:**
- "3 ways **to double email opens** for **B2B marketers**"
- "How to **ship features faster** without **burning out your team**"
- "The truth about **SaaS pricing** that **most founders** miss"

## Topic Best Practices

### Be Specific

**Instead of:** "Productivity tips"  
**Write:** "How to get 3 hours back every day with calendar blocking"

**Why:** Specific topics generate more targeted, valuable content.

### Include Numbers

Numbers attract attention and set expectations:
- "3 ways to..." (viewer knows it's quick)
- "Save 10 hours per week..." (concrete benefit)
- "40% increase in..." (specific outcome)

### Make it Audience-Relevant

Include your audience in the topic:
- "...for remote teams"
- "...that CFOs care about"
- "...every marketer needs"

This helps the AI generate more targeted messaging.

### Match Template Structure

If you selected "5 Tips Template," your topic should naturally fit 5 tips.

**Good:** "5 Chrome extensions every developer needs"  
**Bad:** "Why Chrome extensions are useful" (doesn't fit 5-part structure)

## Switching Topics Mid-Generation

Changed your mind? You can restart:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait for Generation to Complete">
    Let the current generation finish (or it will be lost)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Back">
    Click the **← Back** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose New Topic">
    Select a different topic or write a new one
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Brand Kit Selection

If you have multiple Brand Kits (for different brands), you can switch which one the AI uses:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Brand Kit Dropdown">
    Above the topic selection, click your current Brand Kit name
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Different Brand Kit">
    Choose another brand from the dropdown
  </Step>

  <Step title="Topics Regenerate">
    AI suggestions automatically update for the new brand
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Multi-brand use case:** If you manage multiple companies, create separate Brand Kits and switch between them when generating content.
