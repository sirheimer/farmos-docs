## What is Juice?

Juice helps you build organic visibility on TikTok by combining three powerful elements:

1. **AI Content Creation** - Generate scroll-stopping short-form videos optimized for the TikTok algorithm
2. **Multi-Account Strategy** - Deploy content across multiple accounts to test at scale and maximize reach
3. **Automated Posting** - Set it and forget it - Juice handles posting, scheduling, and account warmup

## How Juice Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Brand Identity">
    Create a Brand Kit with your company's DNA - logos, colors, voice, and target audience. Juice's AI analyzes your website to automatically extract your brand essence.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Viral Content with AI">
    Choose from 50+ proven templates, describe your topic, and watch as AI generates unique slideshow videos in seconds. Edit until perfect with simple text prompts.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy to Multiple Accounts">
    Create branded, faceless, or UGC-style accounts. Juice automatically creates the accounts on TikTok, warms them up, and starts posting your content.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Track Performance and Scale">
    Monitor views, engagement, and viral rates across all accounts. Identify winning content and duplicate it to more accounts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Who is Juice For?

Juice is built for growth-focused brands and marketers:

- **B2B Companies** - Build thought leadership and generate leads through educational content
- **DTC Brands** - Drive product awareness and conversions with engaging product videos
- **Content Creators** - Scale your personal brand across multiple accounts without 10x-ing your workload
- **Agencies** - Manage multiple client brands with separate Brand Kits and account pools

## Why Multiple Accounts?

The TikTok algorithm has shifted from follower-based to content recommendation feeds. More quality content = more visibility, but testing at scale requires multiple accounts:

- **Test Variations** - Same content, different hooks. See what resonates.
- **Reach Different Audiences** - Branded vs faceless accounts attract different viewers
- **Algorithmic Diversity** - Multiple accounts mean multiple shots at viral content
- **Risk Mitigation** - If one account gets flagged, your others keep running
