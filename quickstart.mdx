## Step 1: Watch the Platform Overview

Before diving in, watch our Loom tutorial to understand how everything connects:

    allowFullScreen 
    style={{position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%"}}
  />
</div>

## Step 2: Create Your Brand Kit

Your Brand Kit is your brand's DNA - it tells the AI how to create content that sounds and looks like you.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Brand Hub">
    Click **Brand Hub** in the sidebar, then **Create Brand Kit**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Your Website">
    Paste your company website URL. Juice's AI will analyze it and extract:
    - Brand description
    - Product/service info
    - Target audience
    - Tone of voice
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review & Enhance">
    Review the AI-extracted information. Edit any fields to make them more accurate. Add:
    - **Brand Colors** - Your hex codes
    - **Logo** - Upload your brand logo (PNG with transparency works best)
    - **TikTok Keywords** - Topics for algorithm targeting (e.g., "SaaS, productivity, remote work")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Enrich'">
    The Enrich button runs AI analysis to improve all your brand fields. Wait ~30 seconds for completion.
  </Step>

    - Each variation assigned to different accounts

## Step 7: Create Accounts

Now let's create TikTok accounts that will post your content.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Accounts Page">
    Click **Accounts** in the sidebar, then **Create Accounts**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Account Mix">
    Select how many of each type:
    - **Branded** (uses your company name/logo) - Great for brand awareness
    - **Faceless** (generic, content-focused) - Great for educational content
    - **UGC** (person-based) - Great for relatable, personal content
    
    **Recommended starter:** 4 branded + 2 faceless = 6 accounts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Generated Profiles">
    Juice's AI creates unique usernames, bios, and profile pictures for each account. You can:
    - Edit usernames
    - Regenerate profile pictures
    - Customize bios
  </Step>

    Click **Create Accounts**. Juice will:
    - Create accounts on TikTok
    - Set up profiles
    - Begin warmup process
    - Start posting after warmup completes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Warmup Period:** New accounts need 3-7 days of warmup before posting starts. During this time, Juice uses the platform to build account trust with TikTok's algorithm.
