## Viral Rate

**Formula:** Posts with 100K+ views / Total posts × 100

**Benchmarks:**
- 5% = Good (1 in 20 posts goes viral)
- 10% = Great (1 in 10 posts goes viral)
- 20%+ = Exceptional

## Viewing Viral Content

**Dashboard** shows:
- Count of posts at each milestone level
- Your overall viral rate %
- List of viral posts

**Click any viral post** to see full analytics and duplicate.

## Using Viral Data

When a post goes viral:

1. **Analyze why it worked**
   - What was the hook?
   - Which template?
   - What topic?
   - Which account type?

2. **Duplicate the winner**
   - Create similar content
   - Same template + different topic
   - Post to more accounts

3. **Scale the formula**
   - If "3 Ways" template went viral, create more "3 Ways" content
   - If faceless accounts outperform, create more faceless accounts
