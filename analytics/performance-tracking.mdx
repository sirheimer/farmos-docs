## Key Questions to Answer

### Content Level

- What's our average views per post? (Goal: 10K+)
- Which template performs best?
- Which topics generate most engagement?
- Any patterns in viral content?

### Account Level

- Which account type performs best? (Branded vs Faceless vs UGC)
- Are all accounts posting consistently?
- Any accounts stuck in warmup?
- Which accounts should scale to 2-3x/day?

### Strategic Level

- Is our viral rate improving? (Goal: 5%+)
- Are we creating enough content to feed all accounts?
- Should we add more accounts or improve content first?
- What's our ROI vs paid ads?

## Data-Driven Decisions

### Decision: Scale Posting

**If** average views &gt;10K and viral rate &gt;5%  
**Then** increase frequency from 1x to 2x per day

### Decision: Add Accounts

**If** all accounts posting 2x/day and &gt;50K views/week total  
**Then** add 3-6 more accounts

### Decision: Focus Content

**If** one template consistently outperforms (2x views of others)  
**Then** create 80% of content with that template

### Decision: Archive Account

**If** account &lt;1K average views for 30+ days  
**Then** archive and create replacement
